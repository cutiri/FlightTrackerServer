# FlightTrackerServer

`FlightTrackerServer` is the backend component of a Flight Tracker website that monitors flights in real-time around the globe. Built using Node.js and JavaScript, this server-side application queries multiple APIs to retrieve and manage up-to-date flight information, including aircraft images based on registration numbers. It integrates with MongoDB for data storage and serves API requests from the frontend application, [FlightTrackerClient](https://github.com/cutiri/FlightTrackerClient).

## Overview

The FlightTrackerServer project provides real-time tracking of global flights by querying flight data APIs and storing relevant information in a MongoDB database. It responds to API requests from the FlightTrackerClient, which handles the frontend interface for users to interact with the flight data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Flight Tracking**: Tracks flights around the world in real-time.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes MongoDB to store flight information and historical data.
- **API Integration**: Queries the Airlabs API for updated flight information and aircraft images.
- **Backend API**: Provides API endpoints for the frontend client to retrieve flight data.
